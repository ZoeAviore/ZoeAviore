👋 Hi, I’m Zoe Aviore (@ZoeAviore).

👀 I’m interested in exploring the depths of love in all its forms—whether it's love for people, art, nature, or learning.

🌱 I’m currently learning about the psychology of love and relationships, and how to cultivate deeper connections with others.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that promote love, compassion, and understanding in communities, such as social initiatives, mental health awareness campaigns, and artistic endeavors that spread positive messages.

📫 How to reach me: 

😄 Pronouns: She/Her.

⚡ Fun fact: I once organized a community event where people shared love letters they had written to themselves, fostering self-love and appreciation.
